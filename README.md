# Tasks

The MEDIQA-Sum task focuses on the automatic summarization and classification of doctor-patient conversations through three subtasks:

* Subtask A - Dialogue2Topic Classification.  Given a conversation snippet between a doctor and patient, participants are tasked with identifying the topic (associated section header). Topics/Section headers will be one of twenty normalized common section labels (e.g. Assessment, Diagnosis, Exam, Medications, Past Medical History).

# Packages

* All the required packages are in the relevant code files ( either commented or in chunks). The most commom packages are:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. nltk
4. tensorflow
5. transformers
6. keras
7. sklearn
8. seaborn 
(packages are not limited to this list above)

# Dataset
Dataset is under dataset folder under SubTask A.

# Running the Code
 Using Jupyter notebooks, or collab (with either GPU or TPU). Upload dataset files to local directory, and change paths (run time).
